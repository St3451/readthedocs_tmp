Welcome to Oncodrive3D's documentation!
=======================================

**Oncodrive3D** is a method designed to analyze patterns of somatic 
mutations across tumors to identify three-dimensional (3D) clusters 
of missense mutations and detect genes that are under positive selection, 
and, therefore, are capable of driving tumorigenesis.

For practical information on how to setup and run Oncodrive3D, check out the 
:doc:`usage` section, which includes information for the :ref:`installation` 
process, :ref:`building datasets` necessary for the tool to run, and 
:ref:`running 3D-clustering analysis`.
